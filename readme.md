This code creates a URL shortening web app using Node.js, Express, EJS, and MongoDB.

Code Explanation:

The code imports necessary modules, including the mongoKey module, which contains a secret key to connect to a MongoDB Atlas cluster.
The code sets up the server's host and port number using process.env.PORT or the default value of 3000.
The code initializes the Express application and sets up middleware to handle URL-encoded and JSON data, as well as serve static files and templates using EJS.
The code connects to the MongoDB Atlas cluster using Mongoose, a MongoDB object modeling tool for Node.js.
The code defines a URL schema and creates a URL model using Mongoose to store long URLs, short URLs, and click counts.
The code defines functions to generate random strings and validate HTTP URLs.
The code sets up routes for handling GET and POST requests to the home page, which displays a form for users to submit a long URL to be shortened.
The code handles the form submission by checking if the URL is valid and generating a random string to use as the shortened URL parameter. If the URL is valid, it creates a new URL document and saves it to the MongoDB database. If the URL is not valid, it sends an error message to the user.
The code sets up a route for handling GET requests to shortened URLs. It finds the corresponding URL document in the MongoDB database using the URL parameter and increments its click count. If the URL document is found, it renders a waiting page that redirects to the long URL after a short delay. If the URL document is not found, it renders a 404 error page.
The code starts the Express server and listens for incoming requests on the specified port number.
Overall, this code sets up a basic URL shortening web app that allows users to submit long URLs and generates shortened URLs that redirect to the original long URLs. It stores the URLs in a MongoDB database and tracks the number of clicks for each shortened URL.
